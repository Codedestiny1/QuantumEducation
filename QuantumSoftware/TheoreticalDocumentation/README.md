The `.zip` file contains the source files of the documentation written with LaTeX in case anyone wants to compile the source by themselves to edit it. Other than that, one can use [this link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qvfsysjywwvg) to just view the document and [this link](https://www.overleaf.com/7874219767ddyhftdrnmqp) to edit the document on Overleaf.
