# Quantum Computing Documentation Developed For HARPE Engineering

This repository contains the theoretical and practical quantum information/quantum computing documentations put together for HARPE Engineering. The theoretical and practical documentations each contain instructions on how to use them in their respective folders as README.md files.

### How To Get The Best Out Of This?

1) Start with the theoretical documentation and follow the instructions for it.
2) Feel free to use the IBM Quantum Composer to try out the circuits mentioned in the documentation graphically without typing any code and get a better understanding of how everything works.
3) Start going through the practical documentation and follow the instructions for it.
4) Reach out to experts or check out the resources listed below if you have further questions.
