# Quantum Hardware Documentation

This repository contains the theoretical and practical quantum hardware documentations put together by HARPE Engineering. Several tutorials about transmon design and analysis using the Qiskit Metal software are appended at the end of the document. The tutorials are also available in the repository under **INSERT LOCAL LINK HERE** as well. 


### Preliminaries
- A working installation of Qiskit Metal is required to run the tutorial notebooks. **INSERT QISKIT METAL INSTALLATION STEPS HERE**
- A working installation of ANSYS HFSS is required to run the notebooks that are under the **Analysis** section.
- Intermediate/Advanced knowledge of quantum mechanics, electronics and mathematics is needed to understand the theory behind quantum hardware design.


Note that some of the tutorials need ANSYS HFSS for the analysis of designs made in Qiskit Metal and the ANSYS student version does not contain the HFSS module. The outputs of code cells in the tutorial notebooks are available in the document for the users to follow without a working installation of ANSYS HFSS.
